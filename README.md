# Coomat-Drive
Fun project to create a server/ui for a cloud file storage server to run locally on my raspberry pi

To be able to run the project locally you will need to:

`cd client`
`npm install`
`npm start`

`cd backend`
`npm install`
`npm start`

both the client and the back end will need to be running at the same time for the application to work.
